                <p class="u-textLeft">I am very interested in technologies and I found that most of my friends and family members learned new tech words such as metaverse, NFT, cryptocurrency, etc. from social media, so I am quite curious about the reaction of normal people who have little knowledge about how the technology works to those new tech words raised by those big tech companies. How these ordinary people involved in market behavior will affect the stocks of those big tech companies. In brief, my temporary topic can summarized as peopleâ€™s reactions to emerging tech terms on different social platforms and stocks of associated tech companies.</p>
